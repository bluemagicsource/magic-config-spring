### magic-config-spring
This project contains the integration points that allow SpringFramework to hook into magic-config. Ultimately these integration points will be contributed back into the SpringFramework project and this library will become unnecessary. Also provided here are some utility classes used to aid/troubleshoot configuration in spring context files when injecting magic-config.
